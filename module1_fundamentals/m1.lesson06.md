## WEBbeast Retrospective

***How can we make it better?***

---

### Continue Server practice: Recap
- We've created static server based on [Pure nodeJS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework)
- I've uploaded a [demo server](https://github.com/WEBbeast2018/class-practice/tree/master/m1.lesson5_6.flights-server-stage1) which meet the requirements for stage 1. You may use it as a starting point.
- Upload the project to a repo of your own and work with PRs

---


### Continue Server practice: stage 1 - reminder
- create a server than can serve html, css, js, json files
- file can be accessed only if it's in `public` folder


---

### Continue Server practice: stage 2 - reminder
- work in teams of 2 people
- No. 1 will build Flights server side (Data and data filter by to/from)
- No. 2 will build Flights client side (Flights table, sorting, time limit etc.)
- Both team members should understand all of the code

### Continue Server practice
A few words about nodeJS
- modules - what are they, and what is "require"?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- What is npm?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### JQuery basics - what is it?
* Write less, do more library
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Originally designed for cross-browsing
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Using Css-based queries
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Provide effective AJAX wrapper
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Since modern Browser are comply with standard and provide good DOM navigation functions - why should we use it?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### JQuery basics - why learn it in at 2019?
* You most likely to bump into it online
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* You most likely have to work with it, as many projects use it.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Backward compatibility (designed for cross-browsing)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* May offer a good solution for some projects (mainly small projects)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Support easy and fast-to-write UI solutions (Animations/Fade, JQuery UI)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Good extensibility (plugins support)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### JQuery basics - [Download](https://jquery.com/download/)
* Adding JQuery as a file (minified vs plain)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Adding JQuery (or any library) with CDN
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* A word about CDN
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* The modern option: using a package manager
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---


### JQuery basics - document.ready
To make sure the document is full loaded, we'll use document ready event
```js
$(document).ready(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});
```
Shorthand method
```js
$(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});
```
Since entire page is loaded - JQuery script can be placed anywhere (event in the head section)

---


### JQuery basics - the main concept
* you select elements (using selectors), the perform an action on them
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* you can chain actions and selectors
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* make sure you have the correct selectors, especially when chaining
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* empty selectors do not raise an error (they are valid)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---


### JQuery basics - [selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp)

```
$("button").hide();         // hide all buttons
$("button.primary").hide(); // hide all buttons with class primary
$("tr:even").hide();        // hide all even tr's

// hide all links with target equals "_blank"
$("a[target='_blank']").hide();
// hide all links with target NOT equals "_blank"
$("a[target!='_blank']").hide();
```
Style Guide:
[jQuery selectors uses double quotes](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/#quotes)

---

### JQuery basics - [Events](http://api.jquery.com/on/)
```js
$("p").on("click", function(){
    $(this).hide();
});
```
Or - shorthand version:
```js
$("p").click(function(){
    $(this).hide();
});
```
Triggering event:
```js
$("button:first").click();
```

### [JQuery basics](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)
* [DOM manipulation](http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/)
* [Effects](http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/)
* [Traversing](http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/)
* [AJAX](http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/)


---

### JQuery basics - Practice time
* Live Demo (JQuery CDN & DOM manipulation)
* Trivia practice (lesson 1) - do it with with JQuery
    - Write an array with 3-5 questions
    - Display single question to the user and let the user select the answer
    - when the user click on next
        - Show correct / wrong indication for 2 seconds
        - Display the next question
        - Bonus: show scoreboard

---

### Review [JQuery repository](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
Key notes
* See how [it works](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.js)
* Splitting code to modules
* Watch for documentation comments
* Style guide
* Zen hub, issues and PR
* See query returned Object (with dev-tools)
