* [github](https://github.com/) - Here we store all of our code (homework, projects etc.)

* [code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and later on [webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - IDEs
    - See tutorial videos on website
    - Explore extensions (and share with class if you do)
    - Do not start with git manage tools

### Class Recipe
- Pre-study: theoretical lesson - usually 5-15 minutes. (article / post / video / interactive system etc.)
- Class - each will be divided to lesson and practice
- Class ends with:
    - further study: articles, posts, video etc. - a must
    - exercises: a must - do exercises, with *1 week deadline*.
    - extra: not a must, but helpful material to read / watch / practice
    - projects: Any task with deadline of over a week.

Note: `Extra !== Advanced`

### The content Repo
    - A word about reveal-md and course slides
    - Module content and pre/self sections

### Coding
- Using code from outer sources (posts, stackoverflow etc.) is more than allowed
- Do not include code which you do not understand (Must know how to explain it)
- Code reviews of open source code
- Code standards
    - read WEBBEAST_CODE_GUIDE.md
    - See lots of good code
    - Read code style guides (like [AirBnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript))
    - Ask on slack

### Delivering a task
- PR (for small tasks) - each PR should be also as a personal repo.
- PR for a shared exercise repo should be named: `the-task-name(myname)`
- A personal repo (for tasks with lots of code / projects)
- A project (Solo or Team) should also be managed using github tools

### Feedback
- PR: using code review comments on github
- Personal repo - opening github issues OR personal feedback
